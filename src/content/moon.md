# Hello!
I’m a software engineer focused on building real-time, production systems  that have to be fast and reliable. I currently work at Bloomberg, where I’ve spent the last year designing and shipping a trading workflow used by enterprise clients. My day-to-day work spans distributed C++ services, data ingestion and normalization, CI/CD automation, and production observability.

Alongside my professional work, I build AI-powered systems that emphasize latency, multimodal context, and deployment realism. Recent projects include a real-time AI system design interview simulator with streamed ASR → LLM → TTS, and a local semantic file search engine that combines hybrid retrieval (FAISS + BM25), incremental indexing, and daemonized performance.

I’m especially interested in the intersection of AI and systems engineering: how models behave under real constraints, how to serve them efficiently, and how to build infrastructure that makes AI features reliable in production. I care about clean abstractions, thoughtful tradeoffs, and tools that feel intuitive to use.

If you’re building real products with AI and care about performance, reliability, and user experience, I’d love to talk!
